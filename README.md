Building from source
--------------------

### Microsoft Windows
On Windows, WindowGroomer uses [Qt 4.8.4][qt] for
[Microsoft Visual C++ 2010][msvc] and [libqxt 0.6.2][libqxt].

[qt]: http://qt-project.org/downloads
[libqxt]: https://bitbucket.org/libqxt/libqxt
[msvc]: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express

#### Setup
1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010. Any edition, including Express, will
work.
2. Install Qt 4.8.x for VS 2010.
3. Compile and install Qxt:
    1. Download and extract libqxt 0.6.x to a directory.
    2. Open a Qt 4.8 Command Prompt and do the following:

            cd [extracted-libqxt]

            # Compile and install for release
            configure
            qmake
            nmake
            nmake install

            # Compile and install for debug
            configure -debug
            qmake
            nmake
            nmake install

#### Compiling
1. Clone WindowGroomer into a directory.
2. Open a Qt 4.8 Command Prompt and do the following:

        cd [cloned-source]
        qmake
        nmake

For release mode, replace `nmake` with `nmake release`. You may need to copy
some Qt and Qxt *.dll files from their install directories to the
WindowGroomer directory for it to run.

### Linux
On Linux, WindowGroomer uses Qt 4.8.4 (or later within 4.x) and libqxt 0.6.2
(or later).

#### Setup
Install the required libraries using your preferred package manager.

* On Ubuntu (and other Debian-based distributions), run:

        sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools libqxt-*

#### Compiling
1. Clone WindowGroomer into a directory.
2. Open a shell and do the following:

        cd [cloned-source]
        qmake
        make

For release mode, replace `make` with `make release`.
